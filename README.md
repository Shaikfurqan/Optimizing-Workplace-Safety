# Optimizing Workplace Safety Using Deep Learning

This project aims to enhance workplace safety by using computer vision techniques to detect compliance with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) protocols.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains sample image data or paths
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for detection using YOLOv8
- `models/`: Placeholder for the YOLOv8 model weights
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## 🚀 Project Features

- Detects presence of safety gear (helmet, vest, gloves, etc.)
- Alerts for non-compliance
- Based on YOLOv8 object detection model

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- Deep Learning (PyTorch)

## 🔧 How to Use

1. Place the trained YOLOv8 model weights in the `models/` directory.
2. Run the detection script on your video or image dataset.
3. Review outputs for safety compliance insights.
